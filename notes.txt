all reads for instruction mem, regfile, and data mem is combinational (not clocked)
clock controls writing only


**careful for timing violations

The address, data, and write enable must
set up before the clock edge and must remain stable until a hold time
after the clock edge.

single-cycle
- executes an entire instruction in 1 cycle
- easy to explain, simple control unit
- cycle time is limited by slowest instruction

multi-cycle
- executes instructions in a series of shroter cycles
- simpler instructions execute in fewer cycles thant complicated ones
- one instruction at a time, but each instructions takes multiple clocks

pipelined
- executes several instructions simultaneously
- need logic to handle dependencies (forwarding,stalls,etc)
- requres nonarchitectural pipeline registers
